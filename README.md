# Opensea Scraper

⚠ **Problem**: NFT floor prices returned by the Opensea API are not accurate (they lag at least 2 hours, sometimes even a full day it seems). Here is an example of cool-cats floor price actually being 8.5, but the API returns 9.4:

With this utility you can scrape the correct NFT floor prices directly from opensea by using puppeteer.

## Install

```bash
npm install opensea-scraper
```

## Usage
```js
const OpenseaScraper = require("opensea-scraper");

// which nft project to scrape?
const slug = "cool-cats-nft";

// scrape the correct floor price of an actual offer that exists on opensea
const floorPrice = await OpenseaScraper.floorPrice(slug);

// get basic info (from the opensea API)
const basicInfo = await OpenseaScraper.basicInfo(slug);
```

`**slug**` is the human readable identifier that opensea uses to identify a collection. It can be extracted from the URL: https://opensea.io/collection/{slug}

## Demo

```bash
npm run demo
```

## Script to fetch Floor Price from API
**⚠ Important Note**: floor prices fetched with this method are not accurate (not in real time). 
```js
const axios = require("axios");

async function getFloorPrice(slug) {
  try {
    const url = `https://api.opensea.io/collection/${slug}`;
    const response = await axios.get(url);
    return response.data.collection.stats.floor_price;
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
    return undefined;
  }
}

const result = await getFloorPrice("lostpoets");
const result = await getFloorPrice("treeverse");
const result = await getFloorPrice("cool-cats-nft");
```

## To Do List ✅
- [ ] Tests: we need tests to ensure that design changes in the Opensea Webapp do not break the scraper code. 
- [ ] `OpenseaScraper.slugs(n)`: function to fetch all slugs taken from the rankings page: https://opensea.io/rankings?sortBy=total_volume (`n` is the number of pages to scrape) 
- [ ] `OpenseaScraper.getOffers(slug, n)`: see [issue#2](https://github.com/dcts/opensea-scraper/issues/2)
